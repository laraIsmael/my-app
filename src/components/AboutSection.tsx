      <p>
        IHi, I’m Lara — a front-end developer with a knack for blending
        creativity and strategy to deliver user-focused solutions. I’ve spent
        over three years building intuitive, responsive interfaces using React,
        TypeScript, and modern web technologies, including projects for Google
        Wallet and Looker that improved accessibility, boosted engagement, and
        streamlined developer workflows.
      </p>
      <p>
        My background spans software engineering, UX/UI design, and product
        management, giving me a unique edge in understanding the full product
        lifecycle — from concept and research to design, development, and
        launch. Whether I’m coding a new feature, refining user flows, or
        collaborating with cross-functional teams, my goal is always to create
        experiences that are both visually compelling and highly functional.
      </p>
      <p>
        When I’m not coding, you’ll find me designing geometric jewelry, testing
        new creative ideas, or chasing the perfect cup of coffee.
