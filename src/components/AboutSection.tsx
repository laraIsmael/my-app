      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I’m a Front-End Developer with 3 years of experience building modern,
        responsive applications with React. I’ve also worked as a Project
        Manager, leading teams and delivering complex projects on time. After a
        year and a half in operations, I’m back to my coding roots — ready to
        build clean, user-focused interfaces that make a difference.
      </p>
      <p>
        Outside of tech, I’m a jewelry designer who loves combining creativity
        and precision — skills that also inspire my code.
